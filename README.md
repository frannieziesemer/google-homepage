A recreation of the Google search page to practice CSS skills


The following skills have been demonstrated:
    - setup of git 
    - basic html 
    - basic css
        - float and element position 


The pages does not function - it is an exercise purely for html and css

A small project developed as part of my participation in The Odin Project online course
